# Templating and Code Generation test project

Contains some experiments with creating a templating library and using this to do some code generation for serializing and deserialing messages of protocols.
See the subdirectories for more detailed readmes.

Note that this project doesn't actually use Perl, I think Github just thinks that because I used `.t` as the template file extension.

## TemplatingLib

The templating library itself.

## TemplatingLibCLI

The code generation command line program using the templating library.
